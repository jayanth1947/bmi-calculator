# LWC BMI Calculator

This is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator built using Lightning Web Components (LWC). The BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to both adult men and women.

This project was created to demonstrate the power and simplicity of LWC, which is a modern framework for building fast and lightweight web components on the Salesforce Platform. The LWC BMI Calculator allows users to input their height and weight in either the metric or imperial system, and calculates their BMI accordingly. The BMI is then displayed along with a corresponding weight category (e.g. underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese).
